            <p>The Independent Group of Analytical Psychologists (IGAP), based in London, works closely with Jung’s understanding of ‘individuation’ which will lead each Jungian analyst to develop personal values and styles of practice, within a strict code of professional and ethical standards.</p>

                <p>The IGAP programme aims to teach and facilitate study of the theory and practice of the Psychology of Carl Gustav Jung. Based on an intensive experience of individual analysis, it emphasises the reality of archetypal and collective contents and processes of the unconscious psyche as well as personal and interpersonal dynamics. Special attention is given to Jung's Collected Works, and to a range of related clinical and psychotherapeutic issues.</p>

            <h2>Series 1. 1961&#8211;68</h2>
            <p>The Series 1 was introduced, initially for export only, in March 1961. The domestic launch came four months later in July 1961.</p>

            <h2>Series 2. 1968&#8211;71</h2>
            <p>The Series 2 introduced a number of design changes, largely due to U.S. design legislation. The most distinctive exterior feature is the absence of headlight covers.</p>

            <h2>Series 3. 1971&#8211;75</h2>
            <p>The E-Type Series 3 was introduced in 1971, with a new 5.3 L twelve cylinder Jaguar V12 engine, uprated brakes and power steering.</p>
